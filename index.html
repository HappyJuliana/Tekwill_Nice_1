    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental </i> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
        </p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?
    </h3>

    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Wordpress or Wix</li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun &#128516;</li>
      </ul>
